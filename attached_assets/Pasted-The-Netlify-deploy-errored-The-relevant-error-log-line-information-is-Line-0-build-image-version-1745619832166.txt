Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is due to a Rollup error where it failed to resolve the import `"@/components/ui/toaster"` from `App.tsx`.

- Error line: [line 88](#L88)

### Solution
1. Verify that the module `"@/components/ui/toaster"` is correctly imported and exists in your project.
2. If the module exists, add it to `build.rollupOptions.external` configuration to ensure Rollup can handle it.

You can refer to the [Rollup documentation](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#buildrollupoptionsexternal) for more information on configuring external dependencies.
